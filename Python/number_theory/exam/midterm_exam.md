1. The motivation of (              ) is to define the computation in mathematically in addition to represent the efficiency of the computation.
- Turing machine

2. extended GCD 계산

3. Prove that if f_1 = O(g_1) and f_2 = O(g_2), then c_1 f_1 + c_2 f_2 = O(g_1 + g_2) for some positive integers c_1 and c_2 where O(-) is big-O notation.
- f_1(x) < k_1g_1(x) and f_2(x) < k_2g_2(x), then f_1(X) + f_2(x) <= k_1g_1(x) + k_2g_2(x), f_1(X) + f_2(x) <= k(g_1(x) + g_2(x)) 

4. Describe the Division Theorem and prove this theorem.
- if a, b in Z such that b > 0, then there are unique q, r in Z such that a = qb + r with 0 <= r < b
- pf.
<ol>
    <li>0 <= r < b </li>
        
</ol>

5. Let a and b be positive integers. If (a, b = a+2) and a and b are prime, then (a, b) are called (          ).
- Twin primes

6. If n is composite integer, then n has a prime factor not exceeding (      ).
- sqrt(n)

7. The integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n are (       ) if gcd(a_1, a_2, …, a_n) =1 where gcd(-) is the largest common divisors.
- mutually rerative primes

8. An algorithm is a specified (       ) for obtaining a described results from a set of inputs.
- rules

9. The integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n are (    ) if gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1 for all pairs (a_i, a_j).
- pairwise relative primes

10. To analyze the performance of the Euclidean algorithm, we can analyze (     ) since the worst case of this algorithm is related to this sequence.
- Fibonacci numbers

11. Prove that there are infinitely many primes.

12. This theorem says that every positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes. This theorem is (         ).
